# BudaHackSecurity

**BudaHackSecurity** is a personal learning and documentation platform focused on **cybersecurity**, created for **educational purposes** by a student passionate about **Red Team**, **Active Directory**, **malware analysis**, and **offensive security**.

This project brings together **hands-on laboratories**, **write-ups**, **technical documentation**, and **educational resources**, inspired by platforms such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box, but developed through my own learning process.
